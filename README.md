# distributed universal stateless build system configuration documentation

Currently this is just a collection of thoughts, full of inconsistencies and grammatical errors. Everything can and probably will change

## goals
The goal of this project is to create a stateless universal distributed build system. What that means is specified below
### distributed
Not distributed like cluster computing, but distributed like git. You can run builds locally or somewhere else and it will produce the same feeling of happiness, because everything works the same way.
### universal
The build system should be more about specifing the environment of a task, than the actual task.
### stateless
The result of the build shall only depend on the inputs and the configuration. Basically this means reproducible builds.
### build system
A framework in which to execute jobs.

## Ideas
The build system has some concepts, I will describe some of them here.
### Resources
A resource is a versioned set of files in a directory structure. A version is basically a name that identifes a specific configuration of things.
### Resource set
A resource set is a set of input resources, each with a path, that is prefixed to each file of the input resource. A resource set is valid if all files of all input resources can be combined into one root.

If the following named resources already exist and contain the following files:

```
resourcea:
  file.txt

resourceb:
  test/file.txt
  file.txt
```

A valid configuration, containg both resources could look like 

```
resources:
  - name: resourcea
    path: /resa
  - name: resourceb
    path: /
```

and result in this directory structure:

```
/test/file.txt
/resa/file.txt
/file.txt
```

An example for an invalid configuration would be

```
resources:
  - name: resourcea
    path: /test
  - name: resourceb
    path: /
```

because the file at path /test/file.txt is defined by both input resources, so they cannot be combined.

### Resources
A resource is basically just a versioned and executed set of other resources.

### Primary and secondary resources
A secondary resource is reproducible, while a primary resource is not.
A primary resource is usualy a resource, that is fetched from outside the build system or depends on external factors (and its input resources). This could be for example a git repository or a container image. A secondary resource is only from derived from the set of its input resources. It will always produce the same version with the same inputs. The version of a primary resource comes from an external source, the version of a secondary resource is defined only by it's input resources, that it is based on. Technically, there will be no distincition between primary and secondary resources. The terms are used to classify resource behaviour.
#### Thoughts
It could be a good idea, to specifically mark primary resources and to deny things that cause irreproducebility, like internet or time access to all secondary resources. Probably this is a really bad idea.

### Resource
A resource is a set of other resources, that can be merged and build to produce a version of this resource.
It is the yaml code you write in your configuration file.

### Version
A version is the result of a resource produced with a specific set of versions of the input resources. For a secondary 

### Ingredient
When a resource is used as 

### Ingredients
The set of resources, that define a resource are called its ingredients.

### Ingredient version
A ingredient version is a version of a input resource

### Input versions
The input versions are a version of each resource of the inputs

### Versions files

### Version id
Every version of a resource has an id, that is unique between all versions of that resource. The version id can only be determined after the creation finished.

### Input id
Every version of a resource that takes inputs has an id that is solely based on the input version ids and its resource id.

### Resource id
Every resource has an id, that should be unique from all other resource ids. A resource with the same id always has the same inputs and will always produce the same output from the same inputs. The resource id could be a hash of the resource entry. For now it is assumed, that this is true and every resource is reproducible. The same resource name always has to have the same resource id.
#### Problems
A resource will probably produce different output, while its resource entry stays unchanged, if the external task script changes.
##### Solution
For now I just pretend, that this problem does not exist, as it is probably impossible to solve, because it boils down to requiring 100% reproducible builds. Even it is managed to provide the exact same environment every time, there could still be race conditions or random numbers or time messing up the reproducibility.
What could be done is to create some mechanism to determine, whether a resource is probably reproducible.
Also it could be required to supply all needed scripts in the input resources.

### Resource name
The resource name provides easy identification of a resource. Every resource with the same name has to have the same resource id.

### Tasks
While the resource configuration defines the data structure, on which things are done, the task specifies what is done. At the current stage, the plan is to let this be quite loosly defined and basically boil down to execute a command on the host computer. So it could be possible to do quite lowlevel and absolutly not stateless things, like compiling directly on the host. While this is possible, it is not how it is intended to be done. There will be template task configurations, that for example, start a container with the resource configuration as the rootfs and execute a custom command in the container. It is also planned, to create a template, that starts a container in a virtual machine, so you can even define things like cpu architecture in the configuration.
The task of a resource could consist of not only a build script, which is normally executed, but also a script, that is executed to generate the hash of the result.

#### Background
Tasks are defined so freely to allow the easy usage of custom sandboxing techniques, as some tasks can for example not be executed in a container, so you just write a configuration, to do sandboxing in a virtual machine.
#### Thoughts
I would probably really like it, if the task just sets up the environment and gets the ball rolling, and the actual task is part of the resource configuration. The more I think about this concept, the more I like it. Basically the task should just be the way the resource configuration is executed and the resource configuration should contain a script with the actual work

### Task environment
If a taskscript is executed it gets all the data over its prepared workingdirectory.
Currently the working directory contains a `res` directory with the prepared resource configuration. It also contains a resource.yml file with the configuration of the resource.
#### Thoughts
Maybe the task scripts should be able to call the build system to get additional information

### Secrets
The build system itself could store your secrets and a hash of the configuration they belong to for you and automatically apply them only to the correct configuration.

### Files configuration
The files configuration of a resource specifies, which files are actually part of the resource

### State in the build system
The build system probably needs some kind of state and persistent storage to store stuff. I want the build system to be able to run (in default mode) without some kind of daemon, so the state needs to be persited. Currently I think it would be best to create a `.dusb` directory next to the configuration file with everything in it.
#### Resource versions
It is probably needed to store resource versions somewhere
#### Information about resources and resource versions
They should probably stored somewhere around the configuration file. For now this will be stored in a .dusb directory alongside the project configuration as a file and be called the project state file.
#### Information about build failures and stuff


## configuration file format

The configuration file is a yaml file.
Here I will describe the keys in the current format

### `resources: [resource]`
Resources contains all resources, that are invovled in this configuration.

### `resource`
A resource consists of a name, a resource confifiguration, a output configuration and a task

#### `resource.name: string`
The name this resource will be referenced by.

#### `resource.resources: [configurationEntry]`
The resource configuration is an array of configuration entries. The resources defined by the configuration entries will be combined under one common root. If there are no configurationEntrys, this resource is a primary resource.

#### `resource.files: [fileEntry]`
The output configuration consists of a list of file entries, that are part of this resource. The files defined by the fileEntrys make up the resource. If this value is not specified, every file is part of this resource. If this value is specified and left empty, no files are part of this resource

#### `resource.task: [task]`
The task that has to be executed, to produce this resource.

### `configurationEntry`
A configurationEntry is a reference to a resource.

#### `configurationEntry.name: string`
The name of the referenced resource. Has to be the resource.name of a resource.

#### `configurationEntry.path: string`
All files of the referenced resource will be placed under this path. Defaults to / if left empty or not specified.

### `fileEntry`
A file entry defines a file, that will be part of the resource.

#### `fileEntry.path: string`
The path of the file, this fileEntry specifies. The file has to exist, after the task was executed.

#### `fileEntry.name: string`
The name/path of the file in the resource.

#### `task`
The task that will be executed

#### `task.environment`
I still have to deceide how this will be structured. It could be as simple, as a path to a executable, or a real configuration.
For now this only contains a command, that will be executed on host. The

#### `task.environment.command: string`
A command that will be executed. The command will be executed in a directory prepared with a `resource.yml` file containining only the yaml configuration of the current resource, a `res` directory containing the prepared resource configuration and in future maybe a file containing all resource configurations. This is a hacky prototype solution and will probably be replaced in the future

#### `task.*: misc`
In the current thoughts.yml the idea  is, that whatever is defined in `task.environment` has some kind of access to every other key in task.

## project state file
A project state file is a yaml file, that contains the state of the project.
I will probably define it as I implement a first prototype.
